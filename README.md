# RTOS

## Overview
This project involves developing and implementing a Real-Time Executive (RTX) on the Intel DE1-SoC board. The DE1-SoC board is powered by Cyclone V SoC chip, which includes a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 Hard Processor System (HPS) and an Altera FPGA. The RTX will provide a basic multi-programming environment that supports priorities, preemption, dynamic memory management, inter-task communications, and basic console I/O.

## Objectives
1. Develop memory management support in the kernel.
2. Implement a preemptive multi-tasked kernel.
3. Design and implement system calls to manage tasks.
4. Implement mailbox API to support inter-task communications.
5. Work with UART interrupts and design a simple terminal task.

## Software Environment
- **C**: Main programming language
- **ARM DS IDE**: Eclipse-based IDE for programming and debugging Intel DE1-SoC boards.
- **GitLab**: Used for maintaining source code.
- **Putty**: Used for terminal communication.
